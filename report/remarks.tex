\chapter{Conclusions and Remarks}
Our project focused on the study of the \textbf{Present Wrapping Problem}, a special case of the \textbf{2D Bin Packing Problem}, in order to check the
possibility to cut a fixed size paper for a given amount of presents. We studied different approaches and compared them, finding that the most suitable
for our problem description is the \textbf{MiniZinc Constraint Programming}, with an always reasonable time of resolution.\\

We noticed that the \textbf{MiniZinc} framework is more stable, supported and complete in respect of the \textbf{Z3} framework. On the other hand,
we must state that we started our study with the first framework, so our methodology and problem description was biased with the resolution strategies
learnt during the \textbf{CP} development. Maybe a different \textbf{SAT/SMT} model could also outperform our \textbf{CP} model, but our implementations did not.
