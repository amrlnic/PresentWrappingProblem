# PresentWrappingProblem
It is a common practice that a private business rewards its loyal clients with presents, which are typically wrapped in a costly corporate paper covered with the logo of the business. Imagine that you work for such a business which wants to limit the overall amount of paper that can be used for this purpose, in order to reduce the associated expenses. As the combinatorial decision and optimization expert, you are assigned to solve the Present Wrapping Problem (PWP): given a wrapping paper roll of a certain dimension and a list of presents, decide how to cut oﬀ pieces of paper so that all the presents can be wrapped. Consider that each present is described by the dimensions of the piece of paper needed to wrap it. Moreover, each necessary piece of paper cannot be rotated when cutting oﬀ, to respect the direction of the patterns in the paper.
